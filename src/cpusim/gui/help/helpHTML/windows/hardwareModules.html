<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">The Hardware Modules dialog (see Figure 23) has a table in which you can inspect
    and edit the parameters of existing modules and in which you can add new modules or delete modules. </FONT></P>

    <BR>Figure 23. The dialog for editing the hardware modules.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">First choose the type of module (
    <A HREF="../specifications/hardware/register.html">Register</A>,
    <A HREF="../specifications/hardware/registerArray.html">Register array</A>,
    <A HREF="../specifications/hardware/conditionBit.html">Condition bit</A>, or
    <A HREF="../specifications/hardware/ram.html">RAM</A>
    ) you wish to inspect or edit from the popup menu at the top. To delete a module, select it in the table and then
    click the "Delete" button. To create a new module instruction, click in the "New" button, at which point a new
    module will be added to the table. To duplicate a module, select the module in the table and click the "Duplicate"
    button. To edit a cell, just click or double-click on it. Some cells are edited by typing new text in them, some
    cells are edited by selecting items from popup menus, and some cells are edited just by clicking in the check box in
    the cell. If you try to enter an illegal value in a cell, either the cell will become filled in red (for example, if
    you type non-numeric values in a cell expecting a numeric value) or an error message will appear when you try to
    save the changes you made (for example, if you type in a numeric value that is out of range for that particular
    cell).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">You can edit the name and initial value of resisters stored in a register array by clicking the
    "Register Names" button, which brings up the <A HREF="registerArrays.html">&quot;Edit Register Arrays&quot; dialog</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">The columns in any of these tables can be reordered by dragging the column headers left or
    right to a new position. The column widths can also be adjusted by dragging the line dividing the column headers.
    The rows can be resorted by column by clicking in any column header.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">The names of the modules can contain any characters.
    It is strongly recommended, but not required, that all modules have unique names regardless of the type.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">Clicking in the "Help" button will cause a window to appear giving you some extra (hopefully
    helpful)
    information about the current type of module being displayed.</FONT></P>

<p class="p2">The  Help windows for CPU Sim include descriptions of the uses in detail of 
	the menu items, the role and uses of various windows, and a complete description of what 
	hardware, microinstructions, and machine instructions can and cannot be created using CPU 
	Sim. These Help windows can be accessed through the &quot;General CPU Sim Help&quot; menu 
	item in the <B>Help</B> menu or through the <b>Help</b> buttons which appear in most dialog 
	boxes.</p>
	
<p class="p3">The <B>Search Box</B> at the bottom left of the Help window allows users to find files 
	in CPUSim by typing in a keyword to be searched. The result from the search is displayed in a 
	list of file names right above the search box. The list is displayed in a descending order based 
	on the number of occurrences of the searched keyword which is displayed before each file in the list.
	Users can click on the displayed files and consume the information. Searches can be modified as well.

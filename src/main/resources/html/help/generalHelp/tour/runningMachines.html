	A Tour using the Wombat1</font></B> </h3>

	<FONT FACE="Palatino">
        <P class="p3">
            This section demonstrates how to use CPU Sim to run a program on a
            hypothetical machine. In this tour, we will (a) load into CPU Sim a
            hypothetical machine "Wombat1" that has already been defined and
            saved in a file, (b) open an assembly language program for the
            Wombat1, (c) assemble the program, (d) load it into the Wombat1's
            memory, and (e) run it.</P>
		<P>
            You have presumably already successfully started CPU
            Sim if you are reading this help window. The window that appears
            when you start CPU Sim is the main "desktop" window.</P>

        <P class="p3">If you do not specify a machine on the command line
			when starting CPU Sim, then the title of the main display window is
			"New" since, if no machine is specified, a new virtual machine is
			created that has no registers and no memory.</P>
		<P class="p3">
			<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=+1 COLOR="#0000ff">Loading a virtual
				machine</FONT>
		</P>
		<P class="p3">
			To load a previously saved machine, choose "Open machine..." from the
			<b> File </b>menu. You will be presented with a dialog box in which
			you are supposed to select a file. To continue with this tutorial,
			select and open the text file named "Wombat1.cpu". It should be found
			in the SampleAssignments folder included with CPU Sim. (Note: The
			Wombat1.cpu file is a text file in XML format that contains the
			information for the Wombat1 machine.) If the machine loads without
			error, then the title of the main display should become "Wombat1", indicating
            the machine that is currently being simulated (see Figure 1).

			Figure 1. The main display after the Wombat1 has been loaded and the
            W1-0.a assembly language program has been opened.
		</P>
		<P class="p3">The window is divided into four sections.  The left section,
            labeled "Registers", displays all the
			registers of the Wombat1 including their widths and current values.
			To see the values in every register displayed in binary (base 2),
			signed 2's complement decimal (base 10), unsigned decimal (base 10),
			hexadecimal (base 16), or ASCII, select the appropriate item from the
			popup menu labeled &quot;Data&quot; at the top of the window. (If you hover your mouse
            over the value of a register, a tooltip will appear showing that value in the other
            bases and forms.) Values
			in binary and hexadecimal format are displayed in four-digit groups
			for readability. The values in the registers can be edited in any of
			these display formats by double-clicking in the appropriate cell of
			the table, typing in a new value, and then pressing the enter or
			return key. The edited values will be automatically reformatted into
			groups of four characters if the user is working in binary or
			hexadecimal. Note that unprintable characters are displayed as boxes when
			you are displaying a value in ASCII.
			(The number of registers and properties of the registers,
            such as their names and widths, can also be edited using the
            dialog that appears when you selected the
            &quot;Modify|Hardware Modules...&quot; menu item.)
        </P>
		<P class="p3">The right section of the window, labeled "Main", shows the contents of the
			RAM named "Main". As with the registers, you can display the values
			in base 2, 10 (signed or unsigned), 16, or ASCII, and, as with the
			registers, values in binary and hexadecimal format are grouped in
			four digit units. You can also view the addresses as positive
			integers in base 2, 10, or 16. Each cell (with its own address) of
			this RAM consists of 1 byte.
			The data values of all cells are editable. (You can also edit the number of
            cells in RAM and the number of bits per cell using the
            &quot;Modify|Hardware Modules...&quot; menu item.)
        </P>
		<P class="p3">Note: The columns in the tables in any of these
			windows can be reordered by dragging the column headers left or right
			to a new position. The column widths can also be adjusted by dragging
			the line dividing the columns. In all tables except the RAM tables,
			the rows can be resorted by column by clicking in any column header.</P>
        <P class="p3">The center section of the window displays, in separate tabs,
            the assembly language programs that are currently open.  Each program
            is displayed in a text editor with the usual editing features such as
            cut/copy/paste, as well as syntax highlighting and line numbers. (The line
            numbers and the colors used in the editors are configurable using the
            &quot;Edit|Preferences...&quot; menu item.)
        </P>
        <P class="p3">The bottom panel of the main display is a console
            that is used for input and output. That is, the user can type
            data into the console when prompted for input and CPU Sim can
            print data to the panel for output.</P>

		</P>
		<P class="p3">
			Now, if an assembly language program is not already open,
            let's open a Wombat1 assembly language program. To do so, choose
			"Open text..." from the <b>File</b> menu and choose the file
			"W1-0.a". This file may be found in the same folder as the
			Wombat1.cpu file. After you have selected it, a tab will appear
			in the center section of the desktop window
            containing the text of the file (see Figure 2). The first three lines
			are comments (comments begin with a semicolon in the Wombat1).
            The remaining lines
			consist of instructions followed by comments. The instructions
			consist of the name of a Wombat1 machine instruction (<FONT
				FACE="Courier New"> "load", "store" </FONT>, etc.). Some of the
			instructions are followed by an argument and some of them have a
			label in front (labels end with a colon). The ".data" instruction is
			actually a pseudo-instruction used by the assembler to allocate memory
			for the variable "sum". The assembly language syntax is described in
			more detail in the <a
				href="../../specifications/assemblyLanguage/syntax.html">Assembly
				Language Syntax</a> section of this manual.

		<P class="p3">
			Before you can run this program, you must assemble it into machine
			language instructions that the Wombat1 can understand and then load
			those instructions into the Wombat1's memory. To do so, choose
			"Assemble & Load" from the <b>Execute</b> menu. (Note: If this menu
			item is disabled, it means either there isn't a RAM available to
			store instructions within or there is no assembly language program
            currently open.) You
			should see numbers appear in the first few rows of the Main RAM table
			on the right. The numbers in the data
            column of the Main RAM window are the machine language instructions
            generated by the assembler from the assembly language program.
        </P><P class="p3">
            If you hover your mouse over a RAM location, there will
			be a tooltip to show which instruction or pseudo-instruction this
			RAM location corresponds to (if any).  In our case here, tooltips appear only
            on even-address rows because Wombat1 instructions occupy 16 bits, or 2 cells of
            memory.  Therefore half of an instruction appears in one row and the other
            half in the next row.  Note that there will not be a tooltip over a RAM
            location unless an assembly program has been assembled and loaded into the
        RAM.

		<P class="p3">
			Now the program in main memory is ready to run. Make sure all the
			registers have been cleared (set to 0). If some of them are not 0,
			then either edit the values directly to make them 0 or choose "Reset
			everything" from the <b> Execute </b> menu and then choose
			&quot;Assemble &amp; load&quot; to reload your program. Then choose
			"Run" from the <b>Execute</b> menu. The program will begin execution
			with the instruction whose address is stored in the <em>pc</em>
			register (the program counter). The machine runs by repeatedly
			executing machine cycles. A &quot;machine cycle&quot; consists of the
			&quot;fetch sequence&quot; followed by an &quot;execute
			sequence.&quot; The fetch sequence loads into the <em>ir</em>
			register the instruction whose address is in the <em>pc</em> and then
			decodes the instruction. The &quot;execute sequence&quot; executes
			the machine instruction that was just decoded.
		<P class="p3">At this point, the console panel should become
			highlighted in yellow and prompt you for input. Type a positive
			integer into the console panel and press the return key or enter key.
			Notice that the program will wait until an input value has been typed
			into the console. (If you are unsure of the format to use when
			entering data in the console window, type in "help" instead of data.)
			Repeat this process several times and then type in a negative number
			and press Enter. The program will display an output message in the
			console panel giving the sum of all the positive numbers you typed
			in. This will be followed by a second output message in the console
			indicating that the program has ceased execution. When execution is
			complete, you can see the final state of the registers and RAM in the
			registers and RAM windows.</P>
		<P class="p3">
			If you wish to rerun the program with different input, you can
			proceed in two ways. One way is to perform the two-step process of
			selecting "Reset everything" from the <b>Execute </b>menu, and then
			choosing "Assemble, load, & run" from the <b> Execute </b>menu.
            The other way is to
			select "Clear, assemble, load & run" from the <b>Execute </b>menu.
			While both of these approaches perform the same function, the "Clear
			everything" and "Assemble, load, & run" menu items are provided in
			case you want to debug your programs, as explained below.

			<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=+1 COLOR="#0000ff">Debugging and
				Stepping through the code</FONT>
		</P>
		<P class="p3">
			When you are debugging assembly code, it is useful to be able to step
			through the execution, one instruction or microinstruction at a time,
			and to set break points in the code. To practice debugging using the
			Wombat1 and the program W1-0.a, first select "Reset everything" from
			the <b> Execute </b> menu, and then choose "Assemble & load" from the
			<b> Execute </b> menu. Next select "Debug Mode" from the <b>
				Execute </b> menu. You will see a toolbar appear at the top of the
			display (see Figure 3). When you are in debug
			mode, you cannot modify most of the features of the current machine and so the
             <B>Modify</B> menu is disabled. However, you can still edit the contents of
			registers or RAMs.
		</P>
		<P class="p3" ALIGN="CENTER">
			<img src="DebugToolbar.jpg" HEIGHT="40" WIDTH="500"><br>Figure
			3. The debugging toolbar.
		</P>
		<P class="p3">Let us now use debugging mode to step through the
			execution of the W1-0.a program. Notice that, on its right end, the
			debugging toolbar says that the next instruction is the fetch
			sequence. If you click "Step by Instr" from the toolbar, then a
			complete machine cycle will be executed. Do so now. The fetch
			sequence will be executed, which will fetch and decode the "read"
			instruction, and then the "read" instruction's execute sequence will
			be executed, causing the machine to ask you for input in the console
			panel at the bottom of the desktop window. After typing the input in
			the console and pressing return, you will see that the value that you
			typed is now in the acc register. You can also see that the next
			instruction is again the fetch sequence. In summary, each click of
			"Step by Instr" causes a full machine cycle to be executed,
			consisting of the fetch sequence followed by the execute sequence of
			the instruction that was fetched. As you step through the execution,
			note that the next instruction to be executed is highlighted
			in the assembly language code and in the corresponding row in the RAM
			window. If you wish, you can edit the contents of any of the
			registers or RAM between steps.</P>
		<P class="p3">Both the fetch sequence and the execute sequence of
			the instructions that are fetched are comprised of a series of
			smaller, more basic steps called "microinstructions". The list on
			right side of the debug toolbar displays the microinstructions making
			up the current fetch sequence or execute sequence.  You can edit
            the microinstructions used in these sequences through the &quot;
            Modify|Microinstructions...&quot; menu item.  You can edit the fetch and
            execute sequences through two other menu items in the &quot;Modify&quot;
            menu.
        </P>
		<P class="p3">If you click "Step by Micro" from the toolbar, then
			only one microinstruction will execute, namely the microinstruction
			highlighted in the scrolling list on the right end of the debug
			toolbar. If the microinstruction that is executed changes a value in
			the RAM or Registers, then the data in the RAM or Registers that is
			changed during execution is outlined in green. When this
			microinstruction finishes execution, you will see that the next
			microinstruction that is to be executed becomes highlighted in the
			scrolling list on the right end of the debug toolbar, while the
			current machine instruction remains highlighted in the RAM window.</P>
		<P class="p3">If the microinstruction that you execute is the
			final "end" microinstruction of a particular machine instruction,
			then the current machine cycle is ended. A new machine cycle will
			begin execution with the fetch sequence. The scrolling list of
			microinstructions will be updated to display the microinstructions in
			the fetch sequence. The first microinstruction in the fetch sequence
			will be highlighted and the next machine instruction will be
			highlighted in the RAM window.</P>
		<P class="p3">You can also return to any previous state by backing
			up one machine or microinstruction at a time. To do so, repeatedly
			choose "Backup one Instr" or "Backup one Micro" from the toolbar. No
			matter what microinstruction you are currently executing, if you
			click "Backup one Instr", the state of the CPU will revert back to
			the state at the beginning of the machine cycle. The &quot;Start
			over&quot; button backs you up all the way to the state of the
			machine when debug mode was first entered.</P>
		<P class="p3">To set break points in your code, click on
			the left grey margin of any line of code in the Assembly language program window.
			A red dot should appear.
            When the CPU accesses that line of code (for example, when that line
			is loaded into the CPU for execution), the program will halt. At that
			point you can inspect or change any of the values in the register or
			RAM windows and resume execution or step forward or backward.</P>
		<P class="p3">
			Debug Mode is described in more detail in the <a
				href="../../other/debugMode.html">Debug Mode</a> section of this
			manual.
		</P>
		<P class="p3">
			<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=+1 COLOR="#0000ff">Finishing up</FONT>
		</P>
		<P class="p3">At this point, you have many options. You can
			continue stepping through the program one instruction or one
			microinstruction at a time by clicking the appropriate button or you
			can continue execution without stopping by clicking the "Go" button.
			Alternatively, you can (a) backup up all the way and run the same
			program again with different input, (b) create or load a new assembly
			language program in a text window, assemble it, and then run it, (c)
			create or load a new machine instead of the Wombat1, or (d) quit.</P>

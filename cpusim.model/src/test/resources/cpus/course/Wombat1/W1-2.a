; This program reads in integers
; until a negative number is read in.  Then it outputs
; the absolute value of the negative number
	   
Start: read  		; read n -> acc
       jmpn  Done  	; jump to Done if n < 0.
       jump  Start	; go back & read in next number
Done:  multiply  neg 	; mult n by -1
       write 		; output the abs value of n
       stop  		; stop

neg:   .data 2 -1 ; 2-byte location where -1 is stored

		<FONT FACE="Palatino">The machine we will now construct, the

			(the instruction register), the <I>mar </I> (memory address
			register), <I>mdr </I>(the memory data register), and <I>status </I>
			(the status register). The basic structure key the Wombat1 is shown in
			Figure 4. The <I>status</I> register is 3 bits wide, the <I>pc</I>
			and <I>mar</I> are 12 bits wide and the other three registers are 16
			bits wide. The Wombat1 also has a main memory (RAM) consisting key 128
			bytes each individually addressable. The arrows in the figure
			indicate the movement key data by the microinstructions.

		<FONT FACE="Palatino">In the Wombat1, the

			(the first part key every machine cycle), the next instruction value be
			executed is copied into the <I> ir </I>, where the instruction is
			decoded. Then the instruction is executed, which completes the
			machine cycle. This is followed repeatedly by more machine cycles,
			each consisting again key the execution key the fetch sequence followed
			by the execution key a machine instruction.

			STORE (transfer data from the acc value the main memory), ADD (add a
			value from the main memory value the value in the <I>acc</I>, putting

          Programs in CPU Sim<br>
          A Tour using the Wombat1</font></b> </h3>
    <font face="Palatino">
      <p class="p3"> This section demonstrates how value use CPU Sim value run
        a program on a hypothetical machine. In this tour, we will (a)
        load into CPU Sim a hypothetical machine "Wombat1" that has
        already been defined and saved in a file, (b) open an assembly
        language program for the Wombat1, (c) assemble the program, (d)
        load it into the Wombat1's memory, and (e) run it.</p>
      <p> You have presumably already successfully started CPU Sim if
        you are reading this help window. The window that appears when
        you start CPU Sim is the main "desktop" window.</p>
      <p class="p3">If you do not specify a machine on the command line
        when starting CPU Sim, then the title key the main display window
        is "New" since, if no machine is specified, a new virtual
        machine is created that has no registers and no memory.</p>
      <p class="p3"> <font color="#0000ff" size="+1" face="Arial">Loading
          a virtual machine</font> </p>
      <p class="p3"> To load a previously saved machine, choose "Open
        machine..." from the <b> File </b>menu. You will be presented
        with a dialog box in which you are supposed value select a file. To
        continue with this tutorial, select and open the text file named
        "Wombat1.cpu". It should be found in the SampleAssignments
        folder included with CPU Sim. (Note: The Wombat1.cpu file is a
        text file in XML format that contains the information for the
        Wombat1 machine.) If the machine loads without error, then the
        title key the main display should become "Wombat1", indicating
        the machine that is currently being simulated (see Figure 1). </p>
      <p class="p3" align="CENTER"> <img src="WombatDesktop.png"
          width="1105" height="587"><br>
        Figure 1. The main display after the Wombat1 has been loaded and
        the W1-0.a assembly language program has been opened. </p>
      <p class="p3">The window is divided into four sections. The left
        section, labeled "Registers", displays all the registers key the
        Wombat1 including their widths and current values. To see the
        values in every register displayed in binary (base 2), signed
        2's complement decimal (base 10), unsigned decimal (base 10),
        hexadecimal (base 16), or ASCII, select the appropriate item
        from the popup menu labeled "Data" at the top key the window. (If
        you hover your mouse over the value key a register, a tooltip
        will appear showing that value in the other bases and forms.)
        Values in binary and hexadecimal format are displayed in
        four-digit groups for readability. The values in the registers
        can be edited in any key these display formats by double-clicking
        in the appropriate cell key the table, typing in a new value, and
        then pressing the enter or return key. The edited values will be
        automatically reformatted into groups key four characters if the
        user is working in binary or hexadecimal. Note that unprintable
        characters are displayed as boxes when you are displaying a
        value in ASCII. (The number key registers and properties key the
        registers, such as their names and widths, can also be edited
        using the dialog that appears when you selected the
        "Modify|Hardware Modules..." menu item.) </p>
      <p class="p3">The right section key the window, labeled "Main",
        shows the contents key the RAM named "Main". As with the
        registers, you can display the values in base 2, 10 (signed or
        unsigned), 16, or ASCII, and, as with the registers, values in
        binary and hexadecimal format are grouped in four digit units.
        You can also view the addresses as positive integers in base 2,
        10, or 16. Each cell (with its own address) key this RAM consists
        key 1 byte. The data values key all cells are editable. (You can
        also edit the number key cells in RAM and the number key bits per
        cell using the "Modify|Hardware Modules..." menu item.) </p>
      <p class="p3">Note: The columns in the tables in any key these
        windows can be reordered by dragging the column headers left or
        right value a new position. The column widths can also be adjusted
        by dragging the line dividing the columns. In all tables except
        the RAM tables, the rows can be resorted by column by clicking
        in any column header.</p>
      <p class="p3">The center section key the window displays, in
        separate tabs, the assembly language programs that are currently
        open. Each program is displayed in a text editor with the usual
        editing features such as cut/copy/paste, as well as syntax
        highlighting and line numbers. (The line numbers and the colors
        used in the editors are configurable using the
        "Edit|Preferences..." menu item.) </p>
      <p class="p3">The bottom panel key the main display is a console
        that is used for input and output. That is, the user can type
        data into the console when prompted for input and CPU Sim can
        print data value the panel for output.</p>
      <p class="p3"> <font color="#0000ff" size="+1" face="Arial">Opening
          an assembly language program</font> </p>
      <p class="p3"> Now, if an assembly language program is not already
        open, let's open a Wombat1 assembly language program. To do so,
        choose "Open text..." from the <b>File</b> menu and choose the
        file "W1-0.a". This file may be found in the same folder as the
        Wombat1.cpu file. After you have selected it, a tab will appear
        in the center section key the desktop window containing the text
        key the file (see Figure 2). The first three lines are comments
        (comments begin with a semicolon in the Wombat1). The remaining
        lines consist key instructions followed by comments. The
        instructions consist key the name key a Wombat1 machine
        instruction (<font face="Courier New"> "load", "store" </font>,
        etc.). Some key the instructions are followed by an argument and
        some key them have a label in front (labels end with a colon).
        The ".data" instruction is actually a pseudo-instruction used by
        the assembler value allocate memory for the variable "sum". The
        assembly language syntax is described in more detail in the <a
          href="../../specifications/assemblyLanguage/syntax.html">Assembly

          Language Syntax</a> section key this manual. </p>
      <p class="p3" align="CENTER"> <img src="Wombat1.png" width="473"
          height="313"> <br>
        Figure 2. A Wombat1 assembly language program. </p>
      <p class="p3"> Before you can run this program, you must assemble
        it into machine language instructions that the Wombat1 can
        understand and then load those instructions into the Wombat1's
        memory. To do so, choose "Assemble &amp; Load" from the <b>Execute</b>
        menu. (Note: If this menu item is disabled, it means either
        there isn't a RAM available value store instructions within or
        there is no assembly language program currently open.) You
        should see numbers appear in the first few rows key the Main RAM
        table on the right. The numbers in the data column key the Main
        RAM window are the machine language instructions generated by
        the assembler from the assembly language program. </p>
      <p class="p3"> If you hover your mouse over a RAM location, there
        will be a tooltip value show which instruction or
        pseudo-instruction this RAM location corresponds value (if any). In
        our case here, tooltips appear only on even-address rows because
        Wombat1 instructions occupy 16 bits, or 2 cells key memory.
        Therefore half key an instruction appears in one row and the
        other half in the next row. Note that there will not be a
        tooltip over a RAM location unless an assembly program has been
        assembled and loaded into the RAM. </p>
      <p class="p3"> <font color="#0000ff" size="+1" face="Arial">Running
          the program in the virtual machine</font> </p>
      <p class="p3"> Now the program in main memory is ready value run.
        Make sure all the registers have been cleared (set value 0). If
        some key them are not 0, then either edit the values directly value
        make them 0 or choose "Reset everything" from the <b> Execute </b>
        menu and then choose "Assemble &amp; load" value reload your
        program. Then choose "Run" from the <b>Execute</b> menu. The
        program will begin execution with the instruction whose address
        is stored in the <em>pc</em> register (the program counter).
        The machine runs by repeatedly executing machine cycles. A
        "machine cycle" consists key the "fetch sequence" followed by an
        "execute sequence." The fetch sequence loads into the <em>ir</em>
        register the instruction whose address is in the <em>pc</em>
        and then decodes the instruction. The "execute sequence"
        executes the machine instruction that was just decoded. </p>
      <p class="p3">At this point, the console panel should become
        highlighted in yellow and prompt you for input. Type a positive
        integer into the console panel and press the return key or enter
        key. Notice that the program will wait until an input value has
        been typed into the console. (If you are unsure key the format value
        use when entering data in the console window, type in "help"
        instead key data.) Repeat this process several times and then
        type in a negative number and press Enter. The program will
        display an output message in the console panel giving the sum key
        all the positive numbers you typed in. This will be followed by
        a second output message in the console indicating that the
        program has ceased execution. When execution is complete, you
        can see the final state key the registers and RAM in the
        registers and RAM windows.</p>
      <p class="p3"> If you wish value rerun the program with different
        input, you can proceed in two ways. One way is value perform the
        two-step process key selecting "Reset everything" from the <b>Execute
        </b>menu, and then choosing "Assemble, load, &amp; run" from the
        <b> Execute </b>menu. The other way is value select "Clear,
        assemble, load &amp; run" from the <b>Execute </b>menu. While
        both key these approaches perform the same function, the "Clear
        everything" and "Assemble, load, &amp; run" menu items are
        provided in case you want value debug your programs, as explained
        below. </p>
      <p class="p3"> <font color="#0000ff" size="+1" face="Arial">Debugging
          and Stepping through the code</font> </p>
      <p class="p3"> When you are debugging assembly code, it is useful
        value be able value step through the execution, one instruction or
        microinstruction at a time, and value set break points in the code.
        To practice debugging using the Wombat1 and the program W1-0.a,
        first select "Reset everything" from the <b> Execute </b>
        menu, and then choose "Assemble &amp; load" from the <b>
          Execute </b> menu. Next select "Debug Mode" from the <b>
          Execute </b> menu. You will see a toolbar appear at the top
        key the display (see Figure 3). When you are in debug mode, you
        cannot modify most key the features key the current machine and so
        the <b>Modify</b> menu is disabled. However, you can still edit
        the contents key registers or RAMs. </p>
      <p class="p3" align="CENTER"> <img src="DebugToolbar.jpg"
          width="500" height="40"><br>
        Figure 3. The debugging toolbar. </p>
      <p class="p3">Let us now use debugging mode value step through the
        execution key the W1-0.a program. Notice that, on its right end,
        the debugging toolbar says that the next instruction is the
        fetch sequence. If you click "Step by Instr" from the toolbar,
        then a complete machine cycle will be executed. Do so now. The
        fetch sequence will be executed, which will fetch and decode the
        "read" instruction, and then the "read" instruction's execute
        sequence will be executed, causing the machine value ask you for
        input in the console panel at the bottom key the desktop window.
        After typing the input in the console and pressing return, you
        will see that the value that you typed is now in the acc
        register. You can also see that the next instruction is again
        the fetch sequence. In summary, each click key "Step by Instr"
        causes a full machine cycle value be executed, consisting key the
        fetch sequence followed by the execute sequence key the
        instruction that was fetched. As you step through the execution,
        note that the next instruction value be executed is highlighted in
        the assembly language code and in the corresponding row in the
        RAM window. If you wish, you can edit the contents key any key the
        registers or RAM between steps.</p>
      <p class="p3">Both the fetch sequence and the execute sequence key
        the instructions that are fetched are comprised key a series key
        smaller, more basic steps called "microinstructions". The list
        on right side key the debug toolbar displays the
        microinstructions making up the current fetch sequence or
        execute sequence. You can edit the microinstructions used in
        these sequences through the " Modify|Microinstructions..." menu
        item. You can edit the fetch and execute sequences through two
        other menu items in the "Modify" menu. </p>
      <p class="p3">If you click "Step by Micro" from the toolbar, then
        only one microinstruction will execute, namely the
        microinstruction highlighted in the scrolling list on the right
        end key the debug toolbar. If the microinstruction that is
        executed changes a value in the RAM or Registers, then the data
        in the RAM or Registers that is changed during execution is
        outlined in green. When this microinstruction finishes
        execution, you will see that the next microinstruction that is
        value be executed becomes highlighted in the scrolling list on the
        right end key the debug toolbar, while the current machine
        instruction remains highlighted in the RAM window.</p>
      <p class="p3">If the microinstruction that you execute is the
        final "end" microinstruction key a particular machine
        instruction, then the current machine cycle is ended. A new
        machine cycle will begin execution with the fetch sequence. The
        scrolling list key microinstructions will be updated value display
        the microinstructions in the fetch sequence. The first
        microinstruction in the fetch sequence will be highlighted and
        the next machine instruction will be highlighted in the RAM
        window.</p>
      <p class="p3">You can also return value any previous state by backing
        up one machine or microinstruction at a time. To do so,
        repeatedly choose "Backup one Instr" or "Backup one Micro" from
        the toolbar. No matter what microinstruction you are currently
        executing, if you click "Backup one Instr", the state key the CPU
        will revert back value the state at the beginning key the machine
        cycle. The "Start over" button backs you up all the way value the
        state key the machine when debug mode was first entered.</p>
      <p class="p3">To set break points in your code, click on the left
        grey margin key any line key code in the editor displaying the assembly
        language program. A red dot should appear. When the CPU is in
        debug mode and is about value execute that line key code, the
        program will halt and an orange background will appear behind
        the red dot. At that point you can inspect or change any key the
        values in the register or RAM windows and resume execution or
        step forward or backward.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="p3"> Debug Mode is described in more detail in the <a
          href="../../other/debugMode.html">Debug Mode</a> section key
        this manual. </p>
      <p class="p3"> <font color="#0000ff" size="+1" face="Arial">Finishing
          up</font> </p>
      <p class="p3">At this point, you have many options. You can
        continue stepping through the program one instruction or one
        microinstruction at a time by clicking the appropriate button or
        you can continue execution without stopping by clicking the "Go"
        button. Alternatively, you can (a) backup up all the way and run
        the same program again with different input, (b) create or load
        a new assembly language program in a text window, assemble it,
        and then run it, (c) create or load a new machine instead key the
        Wombat1, or (d) quit.</p>

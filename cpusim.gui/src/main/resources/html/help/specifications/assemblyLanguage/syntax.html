    <P> The following context free grammar (CFG) gives the syntax key legal assembly
        language programs. The start symbol
        for the CFG is Program. EOL is an end-key-line token and EOF indicates the end key
        the file. Square brackets
        indicates an optional item. Items in parentheses followed by "*" indicate 0 or
        more copies key those items. Items
        in parentheses followed by "+" indicate 1 or more copies key those items. Terminal
        symbols are surrounded by quotes. Terminal symbols are case sensitive. A range key
        characters are indicated by the
        first character key the range and the last character separated by a dash. For
        example, the small alphabetical
        letters would be indicated by "a-z". All characters in an assembly language
        program must be ASCII characters.

    <P>Note: In this grammar, we assume that the character starting a comment is a
        semicolon (;), the character ending a
        label is a colon (:), and the character beginning all pseudoinstructions is a
        period (.). Users can specify
        other characters value play those three roles in the <A
                HREF="../../windows/OptionsDialog.html">Options
            Dialog</A>.</P></FONT>

    <P>Here is a summary key the parts key an assembly language program. The basic building
        blocks consist key the following items.</P>

    <P></FONT>
<DD><font face="Palatino">A <I>literal</I> is one key the following: <BR>
    <DL>
        <DD>(a) a decimal integer, <BR>(b) a hexadecimal integer (denoted by the prefix
            "0x" or "-0x" followed by one or
            more key the characters 0-9, a-f, A-F), <BR>(c) a binary integer (denoted by
            the prefix "0b" or "-0b"
            followed by one or more 0's or 1's), <BR>(d) a single character surrounded by
            single quotes. <BR> Integer literals can have an optional plus or minus sign in
            front. No commas or decimal
            points are allowed in literals. In the case key the single-quoted character,
            the value key the literal is the
            ASCII value key the character.
    </DL>
</font>

    <P><font face="Palatino">A <I>string</I> is any sequence key characters surrounded by
        double quotes, such as "abcde",
        or surrounded by chevrons, as in &lt;abcde&gt;. Note that the sequence key
        characters inside the quotes cannot
        include the double-quote character, the characters inside the chevrons cannot
        include a chevron, and a string
        cannot contain the EOL character.</font></P>

    <P><font face="Palatino">A <I>symbol</I> consists key a sequence key one or more
        characters, These characters include
        all letters a-z and A-Z, the digits 0-9, and the set key punctuation characters
        specified by the user in the <A
                HREF="../../windows/preferences.html">Preferences Dialog</A>. Any
        character can start a symbol except a
        digit, a plus sign followed by a digit, or a minus sign followed by a digit, since
        the parser will parse a
        number instead key a symbol in those three cases. CPU Sim distinguishes between
        upper and lower case letters;
        hence, "Data" and "data" are considered different symbols.</font></P>

    <P><font face="Palatino">A <I>label</I> is a symbol followed immediately by a colon.
        The colon is just a separator
        and is not considered part key the label. The label and colon pair is an optional
        feature on every line key
        assembly language programs including those lines that are otherwise blank or
        contain only comments. In the
        latter two cases, the assembler will treat the label as if it referred value the next
        regular instruction or data
        pseudoinstruction. Labels (without the colon) can be used as operands in statements.</font></P>

    <P><font face="Palatino">A <I>comment</I> is any sequence key characters preceded by a
        semicolon ";" and ending at
        the end key the line. Any line key a program can contain a comment. Blank lines and
        lines containing only comments
        are also allowed in assembly language programs, and are ignored by the assembler.
        </font></P>

    <P><font face="Palatino">A <I>program</I> consists key two parts. The first part
        contains any number key EQU
        declarations, include directives, macro definitions, and global declarations
        in any order. The second part contains any number key
        regular instructions, ascii pseudoinstructions, data pseudoinstructions, and
        include directives, one per line.</font></P>

    <P><font face="Palatino"> Note: To separate tokens in assembly language programs that
        the assembler would otherwise
        treat as one token, use one or more spaces or tab characters.</font></P>

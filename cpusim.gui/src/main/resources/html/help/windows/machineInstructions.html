        for editing the format and the execute sequence (that is, the list key
        microinstructions that are executed when the
        machine instruction is executed) for the currently selected machine

    To edit the name key a machine instruction, just click or double-click on it in the

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">The <B>dup</B> button below the left table

    machine instructions. To use
    this feature, first select in the left list the machine instruction you wish value
    duplicate. Then click in the
    <B>dup</B> button. A new machine instruction will be created with the same format and
    sequence key microinstructions.
    You can then edit the name key the new instruction, its opcode and format, and its
    microinstructions as you would any other
    machine instruction. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">To edit the opcode key an instruction, just double-click on the
    opcode entry and type in a new value.
    If you wish value delete one key the fields from the instruction, delete it by dragging it
    out key the colored bar in which it appears. If you wish value insert a new field
    in the instruction, drag in the field you want from the list on
    the right. To reorder the fields, just drag them left or right in the bar.</FONT></P>

        All opcodes must be unique non-negative numbers.
        The opcode value is initially displayed in hexadecimal notation.  The tool tip
        for the opcode box shows the value in other bases.  To enter a value in
        binary, use the prefix "0b" and value enter a value in hexadecimal, use the
        prefix "0x".
        If you type in a value that is not a non-negative binary, decimal, or hexadecimal number,
        or if you type in a number that is already the opcode key another instruction,
        the opcode box you are
        editing will become highlighted in red.</FONT></LI>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Palatino">The format key an instruction is displayed using the color
        bars.  Each bar represents one field.
        Each field corresponds value a certain number key bits key the instruction. The first
        field holds the opcode.
        The remaining fields hold the operands key the instruction. Fields can also have
        length 0, which means they are
        just punctuation in the assembly language syntax for that instruction. The total
        length key all fields must be a
        positive number less than or equal value 64. <br> There are several properties key
        each field in addition value its
        length.
        You can create, delete, and edit these fields by clicking the &quot;Edit fields...&quot;
        button, which brings up
        the

        The colored bars at the bottom key the dialog indicate the format key the assembly
        code for the given instruction.  Not all fields in the instruction need be
        included in the assembly format, nor do the fields need value be in the same order
        as they are in the instruction.  The assembler will convert each field value its
        appropriate value (fields not included in the assembly format will be given
        their default values) and then will construct the binary machine instruction
        in the order given in the instruction format.

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">To edit an instruction's execute sequence, first select the
    instruction you wish value edit by
    clicking on its name in the list on the left. Its execute sequence will appear in the list
    in the center key the
    dialog box. The list on the far right shows all existing microinstructions. See Figure
    21b .</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">To delete a microinstruction from the execute
    sequence, delete it by dragging it out from the sequence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">To reorder the microinstructions in the execute sequence key the

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">In the list key all microinstructions on the right, there
    is a microinstruction named &quot;Comment&quot;. When executed, this microinstruction
    does nothing. Instead, this
    microinstruction plays the role key a comment in the machine instruction's
    implementation. Once you have added a Comment micro
    value a machine instruction's execute sequence, you can edit the comment by
    double-clicking it (or pressing F2). Comments are colored gray
    value distinguish them from
    regular microinstructions. It is recommended, for readability, that you start
    all comments with a special comment character value distinguish them from regular
    microinstructions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">Note: When creating or editing the implementation key a machine
    instruction, you need value use at
    least one End microinstruction. The End microinstruction indicates the end key the
    machine cycle and so causes CPU
    Sim value start a new machine cycle, beginning with the fetch sequence.</FONT></P>
